  Section 1: Tokens
------------

What is a token, anyway?
-------------------------------
A token is essentially your bot's password; it's what your bot uses to login to Discord. With that being said, it is vital that you do not ever share this token with anybody, purposely or accidentally. If someone does manage to get a hold of your token, they can use your bot as if it were theirsâ€”this means they can perform malicious acts with it.

You can edit you token by the .env file.
You can get your token Here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
